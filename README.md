# Humanoid_Motion_Mapping
This MATLAB script generates a 3D animation of a humanoid figure based on input joint positions, showcasing human body movement from the mapped input images of a Forward Lounge

## Overview

The repository contains MATLAB code for generating a 3D humanoid animation using basic geometric shapes to represent body parts. The animation demonstrates rotations of the body parts at various joints, creating a realistic simulation of human motion.

## Usage

1. **Setup MATLAB**: Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. **Input Data**: Define the joint positions from your captured frames in the provided format.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the MATLAB script to generate the humanoid animation.
4. **View Animation**: The animation will be displayed in a 3D plot window, showing the humanoid figure in motion.

## Functionality

- **Joint Mapping**: The script maps measured joint positions to a virtual humanoid model, ensuring accurate representation of body movement.
- **Dynamic Animation**: Body parts are rotated at various joints to simulate human motion, providing a realistic and dynamic animation.
- **Customization**: Users can adjust parameters such as limb lengths and joint angles to customize the humanoid model and animation.

## Dependencies

This script requires MATLAB with basic 3D visualization capabilities.
